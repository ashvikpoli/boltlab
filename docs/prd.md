# BoltFit Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create the most engaging and addictive fitness app by combining Phantom Wallet's premium dark aesthetic with Duolingo's proven gamification mechanics
- Eliminate common fitness app pain points through AI automation and inclusive, anywhere-fitness approach
- Build sustainable user engagement through multi-layered progression systems (streaks, XP, social competition, badges)
- Establish a profitable freemium model with $14.99/month premium tier
- Differentiate from existing fitness apps through rest day engagement and automatic tracking innovation

### Background Context

BoltFit addresses the fundamental problem that most fitness apps fail to create sustained user engagement, leading to high churn rates and abandoned fitness journeys. By combining the premium, sophisticated UI aesthetics of Phantom Wallet with the psychologically proven gamification mechanics of Duolingo, BoltFit creates a unique positioning in the crowded fitness app market.

The app targets both existing gym-goers seeking more engaging workout tracking and beginners intimidated by traditional fitness approaches. Through AI-powered automation, social competition features, and innovative rest day engagement, BoltFit transforms fitness tracking from a chore into an addictive daily habit.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

BoltFit embodies a premium, sophisticated fitness experience through a dark-themed interface that feels more like a high-end crypto wallet or gaming app than traditional fitness trackers. The design creates an aspirational, tech-forward atmosphere that makes users feel part of an exclusive fitness community.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Swipe-first navigation** with card-based workout flows mimicking Phantom Wallet's transaction patterns
- **Tap-to-progress mechanics** borrowed from Duolingo's lesson completion satisfaction
- **Gesture-based rep counting** where users can tap or swipe to confirm AI-detected reps
- **Minimal text input** with emoji-based mood tracking and voice commands for workout logging

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Streak Dashboard** - Central hub showing current streak, friend comparisons, and daily progress rings
- **AI Workout Generator** - Smart workout creation interface with equipment and goal selection
- **Active Workout Tracker** - Real-time exercise guidance with automatic rep detection and timer management
- **Rest Day Recovery** - Curated yoga/mobility content with streak-maintaining completion tracking
- **Social Leaderboards** - Friend streak comparisons, challenge participation, and achievement sharing
- **Badge Collection Gallery** - Achievement showcase with rarity indicators and progress toward next unlocks
- **Profile & Progress Hub** - Multi-metric progress tracking (confidence, energy, sleep, fitness) with Wrapped-style summaries

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure high contrast ratios work within dark theme constraints, voice navigation support for hands-free workout tracking, and large touch targets for gym usage with gloves/sweaty hands.

### Branding

Premium dark theme with deep blacks and dark grays as primary background colors. Purple accent colors (#6B46C1 range) for progress indicators, streak flames, and achievement highlights. Subtle gradient overlays and glass-morphism effects to create depth. Minimal use of bright colors except for urgent actions (streak warnings in amber) and celebrations (achievement unlocks in gold).

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Mobile-first design optimized for iOS and Android with responsive web companion for workout planning and progress review on larger screens.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

A single repository using a tool like Turborepo or Nx to manage the mobile app, potential web companion, and shared packages for consistent UI components and business logic across platforms.

### Service Architecture

Mobile-first hybrid architecture with React Native for cross-platform development, backed by serverless functions for AI processing and real-time social features. This approach balances development efficiency with the performance needed for workout tracking.

### Testing Requirements

Unit testing for business logic, integration testing for AI workout generation algorithms, and automated UI testing for critical user flows (streak tracking, workout completion). Manual testing focus on camera-based rep counting accuracy and social feature interactions.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Mobile Framework:** React Native with Expo for rapid development and easy deployment across iOS/Android platforms while maintaining near-native performance for workout tracking.

**AI/ML Services:**

- **Google Gemini API** for intelligent workout plan generation, personalization algorithms, and natural language processing for voice commands
- **TensorFlow Lite** for on-device rep counting and pose detection to ensure real-time performance without API latency

**Real-time Features:** WebSocket connections for live friend activity feeds and challenge updates, with offline-first architecture using Redux Persist for workout data.

**Camera/Sensor Integration:** Native module integration for camera-based rep counting, accelerometer data for movement detection, and HealthKit/Google Fit integration for comprehensive health data.

**Backend Services:** Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda or Vercel Functions for scalable AI processing, user management, and social features without infrastructure overhead.

**Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL for structured user data, relationships, and leaderboards, with Redis for real-time features like live workout sessions and streak notifications.

**Authentication:** Social login options (Google, Apple) with JWT token management, considering fitness app users prefer quick signup processes.

**Push Notifications:** Intelligent notification system for streak reminders, friend achievements, and personalized workout suggestions without becoming spam.

**Analytics & Monitoring:** Mixpanel or Amplitude for user behavior tracking, Sentry for error monitoring, and custom dashboards for tracking engagement metrics crucial to freemium conversion.

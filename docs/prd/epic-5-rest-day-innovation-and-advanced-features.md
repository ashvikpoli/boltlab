## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Your comprehensive BoltFit PRD is ready. Please create a detailed UI/UX specification focusing on the premium dark aesthetic with purple branding, gamification interface design (streaks, badges, XP visualization), and mobile-first user flows. Pay special attention to workout tracking interfaces that support both manual and automatic rep counting, social features that promote positive competition, and rest day engagement that maintains streak psychology."

### Architect Prompt

"BoltFit PRD is complete with comprehensive requirements and epic structure. Please create the technical architecture focusing on React Native + Expo mobile development, Gemini API integration for AI workout generation, TensorFlow Lite for on-device rep counting, and serverless backend supporting the freemium model. Address the data models for gamification (streaks, XP, badges), social features (friends, challenges, leaderboards), and integration with health platforms. Ensure the architecture supports offline-first functionality for gym environments and scalable social features."

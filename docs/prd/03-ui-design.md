# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

BoltFit embodies a premium, sophisticated fitness experience through a dark-themed interface that feels more like a high-end crypto wallet or gaming app than traditional fitness trackers. The design creates an aspirational, tech-forward atmosphere that makes users feel part of an exclusive fitness community.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Swipe-first navigation** with card-based workout flows mimicking Phantom Wallet's transaction patterns
- **Tap-to-progress mechanics** borrowed from Duolingo's lesson completion satisfaction
- **Gesture-based rep counting** where users can tap or swipe to confirm AI-detected reps
- **Minimal text input** with emoji-based mood tracking and voice commands for workout logging

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:

- **Streak Dashboard** - Central hub showing current streak, friend comparisons, and daily progress rings
- **AI Workout Generator** - Smart workout creation interface with equipment and goal selection
- **Active Workout Tracker** - Real-time exercise guidance with automatic rep detection and timer management
- **Rest Day Recovery** - Curated yoga/mobility content with streak-maintaining completion tracking
- **Social Leaderboards** - Friend streak comparisons, challenge participation, and achievement sharing
- **Badge Collection Gallery** - Achievement showcase with rarity indicators and progress toward next unlocks
- **Profile & Progress Hub** - Multi-metric progress tracking (confidence, energy, sleep, fitness) with Wrapped-style summaries

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Ensure high contrast ratios work within dark theme constraints, voice navigation support for hands-free workout tracking, and large touch targets for gym usage with gloves/sweaty hands.

## Branding

Premium dark theme with deep blacks and dark grays as primary background colors. Purple accent colors (#6B46C1 range) for progress indicators, streak flames, and achievement highlights. Subtle gradient overlays and glass-morphism effects to create depth. Minimal use of bright colors except for urgent actions (streak warnings in amber) and celebrations (achievement unlocks in gold).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Mobile-first design optimized for iOS and Android with responsive web companion for workout planning and progress review on larger screens.

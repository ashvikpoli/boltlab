# BoltFit Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create the most engaging and addictive fitness app by combining Phantom Wallet's premium dark aesthetic with Duolingo's proven gamification mechanics
- Eliminate common fitness app pain points through AI automation and inclusive, anywhere-fitness approach
- Build sustainable user engagement through multi-layered progression systems (streaks, XP, social competition, badges)
- Establish a profitable freemium model with $14.99/month premium tier
- Differentiate from existing fitness apps through rest day engagement and automatic tracking innovation

### Background Context

BoltFit addresses the fundamental problem that most fitness apps fail to create sustained user engagement, leading to high churn rates and abandoned fitness journeys. By combining the premium, sophisticated UI aesthetics of Phantom Wallet with the psychologically proven gamification mechanics of Duolingo, BoltFit creates a unique positioning in the crowded fitness app market.

The app targets both existing gym-goers seeking more engaging workout tracking and beginners intimidated by traditional fitness approaches. Through AI-powered automation, social competition features, and innovative rest day engagement, BoltFit transforms fitness tracking from a chore into an addictive daily habit.

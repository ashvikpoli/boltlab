## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Status

Approved

**Epic Goal:** Establish project setup, user authentication, basic UI framework, and core data models while delivering an initial fitness tracking capability that validates the dark UI aesthetic and basic engagement mechanics.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a **developer**,
I want **a fully configured React Native project with Expo, TypeScript, and essential dependencies**,
so that **the development team can begin building BoltFit features immediately with consistent tooling**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. React Native project initialized with Expo CLI and TypeScript configuration
2. Essential dependencies installed: navigation, state management, UI components, database client
3. Folder structure established following monorepo patterns with clear separation of concerns
4. Development scripts configured for iOS/Android testing and debugging
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore and initial commit structure
6. Environment configuration setup for development, staging, and production builds

### Story 1.2: Dark UI Theme Foundation and Design System

As a **user**,
I want **a premium dark interface that feels sophisticated and tech-forward**,
so that **using BoltFit feels like a high-end app rather than typical fitness trackers**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Dark theme color palette implemented with deep blacks/grays and purple accents (#6B46C1 range)
2. Typography system established with clear hierarchy and readability in dark theme
3. Reusable UI components created: buttons, cards, inputs, navigation elements
4. Glass-morphism effects and subtle gradients implemented for depth and premium feel
5. Responsive design patterns established for various screen sizes and orientations
6. Accessibility standards met with proper contrast ratios within dark theme constraints

### Story 1.3: User Authentication and Onboarding

As a **new user**,
I want **quick and secure account creation with social login options**,
so that **I can start using BoltFit immediately without friction**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Social authentication implemented (Google, Apple Sign-In) with JWT token management
2. User profile creation flow with basic fitness goals and experience level selection
3. Onboarding screens explaining core BoltFit concepts: streaks, XP, social features
4. Privacy policy and terms of service integration with clear consent flows
5. Secure token storage and automatic login persistence across app sessions
6. Account deletion and data export options for privacy compliance

### Story 1.4: Basic Workout Tracking and Manual Logging

As a **gym-goer**,
I want **to manually log my workouts with exercise selection and rep/set tracking**,
so that **I can start building fitness data and testing the core tracking experience**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Exercise library database created with common gym exercises and bodyweight movements
2. Workout session interface allowing exercise selection, set/rep input, and weight tracking
3. Workout completion flow with session summary and time tracking
4. Workout history view showing past sessions with date, duration, and exercises completed
5. Basic progress tracking showing workout frequency and total sessions completed
6. Data persistence ensuring workout data survives app restarts and updates

### Story 1.5: Core Data Models and Local Storage

As a **developer**,
I want **robust data models and local storage for user data, workouts, and progress tracking**,
so that **the app functions reliably offline and provides fast access to user information**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Database schema designed for users, workouts, exercises, sessions, and progress metrics
2. Local storage implementation using SQLite/Realm for offline-first functionality
3. Data synchronization strategy defined for when connectivity is restored
4. Migration system established for future schema updates without data loss
5. Data validation and error handling for corrupt or incomplete records
6. Performance optimization for large workout history datasets

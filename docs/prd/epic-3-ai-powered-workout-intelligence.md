## Epic 3: AI-Powered Workout Intelligence

## Status

Approved

**Epic Goal:** Integrate Gemini API for personalized workout generation, implement automatic rep counting with camera/sensors, and create the adaptive planning system that prevents plateaus and routine stagnation.

### Story 3.1: Gemini API Integration and Workout Generation Engine

As a **user who struggles with workout planning**,
I want **AI-generated personalized workout plans based on my goals, equipment, and performance history**,
so that **I never face decision paralysis and always have optimized workouts ready**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Gemini API integration with secure authentication and rate limiting for workout generation requests
2. User goal input system capturing fitness objectives, available equipment, time constraints, and experience level
3. Workout plan generation algorithm producing exercise sequences with sets, reps, and progression logic
4. Performance history analysis feeding back into future workout recommendations for continuous optimization
5. Workout variation system ensuring users don't receive repetitive routines over consecutive sessions
6. Fallback workout templates when API is unavailable to ensure app functionality during outages

### Story 3.2: Equipment Detection and Adaptive Planning

As a **user with varying equipment access**,
I want **workout plans that automatically adapt to my current equipment availability**,
so that **I can work out effectively whether at home, gym, or traveling**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Equipment profile system allowing users to specify available equipment at different locations
2. Smart equipment substitution suggesting bodyweight or alternative exercises when equipment unavailable
3. Location-based equipment detection offering gym, home, and travel workout modes
4. Exercise database with equipment requirements and alternative variations for each movement
5. Real-time plan adjustment when users indicate equipment unavailability during active workouts
6. Progressive overload adaptation using available equipment constraints for continued challenge

### Story 3.3: Camera-Based Automatic Rep Counting

As a **user tired of manual workout logging**,
I want **automatic rep counting using my phone's camera during exercises**,
so that **I can focus on form and intensity without tracking interruptions**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. TensorFlow Lite integration for on-device pose detection and movement recognition
2. Exercise-specific rep counting algorithms for common movements (squats, push-ups, bicep curls)
3. Real-time visual feedback showing detected reps with confirmation mechanism for accuracy
4. Manual override system allowing users to correct counts when detection fails
5. Camera positioning guidance helping users achieve optimal angles for accurate detection
6. Privacy-first implementation ensuring video data never leaves the device or gets stored

### Story 3.4: Performance Analysis and Plateau Detection

As a **user seeking continuous improvement**,
I want **intelligent analysis of my performance data to identify plateaus and suggest progression strategies**,
so that **I continue making gains and avoid stagnation that leads to frustration**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Performance trend analysis identifying when progress stalls across multiple metrics
2. Plateau detection algorithm monitoring rep counts, weights, duration, and subjective difficulty ratings
3. Automated progression suggestions when plateaus are detected (increased intensity, exercise variations, volume changes)
4. Deload week recommendations when performance consistently declines indicating overtraining
5. Goal adjustment recommendations when plateaus persist despite progression attempts
6. Success pattern recognition identifying what training approaches work best for individual users

### Story 3.5: Intelligent Workout Timing and Recovery Optimization

As a **user balancing fitness with life demands**,
I want **AI recommendations for optimal workout timing based on my schedule and recovery patterns**,
so that **I maximize results while maintaining sustainability in my routine**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Schedule integration analyzing calendar data and workout history to suggest optimal timing
2. Recovery pattern recognition tracking performance correlation with rest periods and sleep quality
3. Adaptive scheduling that adjusts workout intensity based on detected fatigue or recovery status
4. Smart rest day recommendations when performance data indicates need for recovery
5. Workout duration optimization suggesting shorter, higher-intensity sessions when time is limited
6. Energy level correlation analysis helping users identify their peak performance windows
